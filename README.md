# ðŸ‘· `worker-sites-template` Hello World

A template for bootstrapping a Workers Sites project.

[`index.js`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the Workers script.

You'll need to link to [this unpublished npm package](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-something) before this worker will build.
